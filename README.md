# Audio_noise_fltering
This is a project to remove noisy part of a audio signal. The process is to identify those nosy frequency and removing noisy information keeping the filtered audio.


The Project Description:
There is a noisy audio data given. the code/task will seperate the audio noise and keep the filtered data, so basically using 
MATLAB and signal Processing tools the frequency related to the noisy audio will be filtered. 
The HTML file contail the live script data along with graps. To listen the corrupted and filtered audio user have to run on MATLAB.
Anyway you can get an Idea from the html file.
